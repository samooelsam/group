Rigs have a single hole drill capacity from 8mm for     smaller anchor bolts and dowel bars, up to 1000mm     in diameter for installing   large  pipes. These units     can be operated manually or automatically from     virtually any angle.       Our self contained,     hydraulically driven     trailer rigs, drill cores     of up to 750mm in     diameter. Requiring     no fixing, they enable     work to be carried out     on external jobs where     securing to a surface is     not an option.                                      The ‘Stitch Drilling’                                 technique, where holes                                 are drilled next to                                 each other, provides                                 countless options,                                 with opening sizes                                 becoming unlimited.          When noise pollution is     a major consideration,     diamond drilling is     fast and virtually     silent, enabling work     to continue and     deadlines to be met.","Wall and Track Sawing         A  fast and precise straight  line method  to  create     openings  in  concrete  and  masonry.  It  is typically     used to cut appetures for doorways and  windows,     as well  as reducing wall  heights, and forming lift-     shaft openings.      With up to 1000mm depth of cut, track sawing is also     ideal  for making separation cuts between walls and     floors prior to demolition operations.       Track saw units have     a digital cutting head,     blade guards, power     pack and a track     system, all anchored     to the surface being     cut.  The cutting head     moves along the     track, powered by 3     phase electricity.                                    Our blades range                                 from 450mm to 2.2m in                                 diameter, giving us the                                 ability to cut to depths                                 in excess of 1 metre.                                 Machines can also be                                 fitted with flush cutting                                 flanges enabling tight                                 cuts to any structures.          Our fleet of over     20 track saws are     remotely controlled     making them safe as     well as precise and     efficient pieces of     equipment.","Wire Sawing         Wire sawing is a very versatile and efficient method of     cutting large or difficult sections of heavily reinforced     concrete, with the added benefit of the operation     being dust and vibration free.      The procedure can be used successfully under water,     which  is ideal and  cost  effective  when  working  in     tidal situations or  water filled tunnels.        Wire saws are perfect     in complex, awkward     or confined spaces.      A diamond beaded     wire is fed around a     structure and through     a pulley system whilst a     constant pulling force     is applied, forcing the                                    wire to carve through                                 the material.                                  Where wire sawing is                                 the only solution, i.e.                                 on ground bearing                                 slabs over 1m deep,                                 a plunge wire sawing                                 method is used.          Through continual     investment, we use     the most advanced,     high frequency wire     sawing technology     and equipment in the     industry today.","Floor Sawing         We have an extensive range of diesel and 3 phase     electric  floor  saws,  capable  of  taking  blades  from     450mm to  1500mm, which provide us with cutting     depths of up 630mm.      Our  Floor  Sawing  services are  perfect  for  cutting     external  horizontal  surfaces such as roads,     pavements and airport  runways,  producing  clean     edges in a very short space of time.       We also specialise     in sawing internal     floor slabs such as     in shopping malls,     factories, supermarkets     and hospitals, where     we can achieve     cutting depths of up to     480mm.                                        In these locations, the                                 speed of operation                                 and consideration for                                 the environment and                                 the public is of the                                 utmost importance.           Utilising our self-     propelled cutting     saws, we also offer an     expansion joint cutting     service, creating     joints up to 20mm     wide, quickly and     accurately.","Bursting and Crushing         Concrete Bursting or Hydraulic Bursting is a safe and     environmentally friendly method  of weakening,     cracking and demolishing large structures.      It enables the removal of smaller more managable     pieces of  concrete,  in a silent and vibration free     way, without the use of large machinery.          This system is ideal     when the required     concrete removal is     very close to another     structure, raising     concerns regarding     the effect of vibration     on the building’s     foundations.                                     The technique                                 of ‘Crushing’ is                                 used for removing                                 concrete with                                 hydraulic concrete                                 crackers, allowing                                 easy reduction of                                 reinforced concrete                                 into rubble.          Due to this method     being almost noise     and vibration free,     its use is preferred     over conventional     demolition processes.","Remote Controlled Demolition         Our  cost-effective  fleet  of  electro-hydraulically     powered robotic excavators, allow work to proceed     in the smallest of areas with no harmful fumes and by     design,  removes the  operator  from  any hazardous     situations.      With an array of attachments and minimal  noise     emissions, remote BROKK demolition also alleviates     hand-arm vibration problems.       With our extensive fleet     of modern BROKK’s     ranging from 60 up to     the 400, we are able     to operate in many     confined, difficult and     challenging locations     such as basements     and stairwells.                                     Small machines                                 weighing only 380kg                                 are ideal for scaffold                                 access, whilst the Brokk                                 400 is as powerful                                 as a conventional                                 excavator. Cracking                                 concrete generates                                 little noise or vibration         and less structural     damage risk.  Saving     time and money,     BROKK’s productivity is     outstanding, enabling     safe, environmental     demolition in the most     testing sites.","Floor Planing         We offer a concrete  Floor Planing service for the     removal of surplus or unwanted material. This is often     utilised  for  the  levelling  of  screeds  from  floors  and     slabs after poor construction.
