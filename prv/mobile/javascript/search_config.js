With                the current challenges presented by the ongoing                climate crisis, we recognise that it is crucial to                ensure sustainability and circular principles are                at the forefront of every project John F Hunt                undertakes.                 This document explains our efforts to reduce our                impact on the environment, conserve resources,                and encourage responsible practises.  Ranging                from initiatives like reducing waste through reuse                programs to reducing pollution and C02 emissions                which protects the health off all nearby residents.                Additionally our sustainability plan doesn’t just                apply to our site; it also reaches out to the wider                community, spreading awareness and inspiring                positive changes.                 We understand that GPE seeks not just a                construction partner but a collaborator who                comprehends the significance of this endeavour and                can seamlessly integrate their aspirations into every                facet of this project. As we explore the intricacies                of 180 Piccadilly, we aim to translate your core                principles into reality. Circular economy and                carbon reduction will be at the core of our project,                mirroring GPE’s commitment to building a better                future.                 Through our tender return, we intend to                demonstrate our unwavering commitment to                quality, safety, and environmental responsibility.                We believe that our proven track record, coupled                with our alignment with GPE’s objectives, makes                us the ideal partner to bring your vision for 63-81                Pelham Street to fruition. Together, we will create a                space that inspires innovation, fosters collaboration,                and embodies the principles of sustainability.","180 Piccadilly, London                3                   SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS PAGE                       1.

By carefully planning and executing every phase of the project with environmental and social responsibility in mind, we have transformed this site into a beacon                of sustainable construction practises. This case study explores the diverse initiatives undertaken during the demolition and soft strip, emphasising their positive environmental and community                impacts.                 One Exchange Square, a prime location in London, was set for redevelopment. Traditional demolition practises would have resulted in extensive waste, carbon emissions, and disruption to the                local community. However, John F Hunt recognised the opportunity to adopt a sustainable approach and mitigate these negative effects.

The history of London City Temple dates back to 1874 when it was established as the “Cathedral                of Free Churches” in England. Although the grand Victorian edifice still stands today, much of the building was ravaged during the Blitz. Thanks to the generosity of John D. Rockefeller Jr., the                City Temple was reconstructed in the 1950s, sparing no expenses. This reconstruction included the installation of a state-of-the-art pipe organ by J.W. Walker \& Sons. The design of the new                instrument was crafted by William McKie, the Organist of Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.                 When the decision was made to redevelop the site, John F Hunt Group, a leading demolition and enabling works contractor, was entrusted with the task of safely demolishing the existing                 structure and preparing it for its exciting new chapter. This case study highlights the considerate and sustainable approach taken by John F Hunt Group during the demolition and soft strip of the                London City Temple site.

Walker \& Sons organ                from London City Temple to Chicago’s St. James Cathedral for restoration. This project aims to bring a                world-class organ to the cathedral and preserve a valuable musical treasure.                 The London City Temple team reviewed the restoration methodology proposed by John-Paul Buzards and                ensured it complied with UK legislation for removing this musical heritage. The Buzard Organ Company,                known for its expertise in English organ building, was involved in the restoration.                London City Temple, established in 1874, was rebuilt in the 1950s with a state-of-the-art pipe organ by                J.W. Walker \& Sons, designed by William McKie. The organ captures the grandeur of the Edwardian era and                mid-20th-century neoclassical reforms. St. James Cathedral’s Director of Music, Stephen Buzard, visited                and documented the organ in February 2023, leading to a unanimous recommendation to acquire it for the                cathedral.                Relocating organs is often a complex endeavour due to their custom-built nature for specific spaces. However,                in this instance, the alignment between St. James Cathedral and the Walker Organ are a match made in                heaven for several reasons:                 •  Installation of a heritage organ aligns with principles of the circular economy and responsible stewardship                    of our planet’s finite resources. Additionally, certain stops on this organ contain materials that could not                    be feasibly replicated today due to their opulent nature.                 •  Built just one year apart, St. James Cathedral and the London City Temple are similar in cubic volume,                    acoustical profile, and layout. Consequently, the organ pipes should require minimal adjustments to adapt                    to their new environment.                 •  The London City Temple organ is not enclosed within a case, allowing the St James Cathedral to retain one                    of the oldest organ façades in Chicago                For a demonstration of the organ’s performance, the St. James Cathedral has graciously provided a link to the                aforementioned organ testing conducted in February of 2023. You can access the demonstration through the                following link: London City Temple - Organ Demonstration                              The demolition and soft strip of the London City Temple by John F Hunt Group is a testament to the company’s unwavering commitment to responsible and sustainable construction practises.

This                case study explores how John F Hunt, a leading construction and demolition company, has demonstrated its commitment to sustainability, circular economy principles, and carbon reduction by                efficiently reusing the Euston Parcel Deck Steelwork.                 Euston train station, a critical transportation hub in London, has undergone extensive renovations and upgrades as part of the HS2 project. In this transformation, several structures,                including the station roof’s steelwork, needed to be removed. Traditional practises would have involved transporting this steelwork off-site via road, a process that not only consumes                 valuable space but also generates significant carbon emissions.

As a considerate                 constructor, we have undertaken innovative measures to reuse glass and floor slabs, significantly reducing waste and environmental impact. This case study delves into our approach to glass and                floor slab reuse, highlighting the processes and benefits of these initiatives.                 Euston Tower, a prominent landmark in London, is undergoing substantial renovations. Traditionally, such projects involve extensive demolition and disposal of materials, resulting in significant                waste generation and carbon emissions. However, John F Hunt is dedicated to breaking this mould and is actively working to maximise the reuse of existing materials, specifically focusing on glass                and floor slabs.

This noise modelling                clearly shows the areas that will be impacted by noise with all efforts in ensuring that the local communities                will not be negatively impacted.                 John F Hunt will mitigate noise emissions on site through hoarding, acoustic monarflex screening and the                methodologies used. John F Hunt will also have permanent noise monitoring on site that will send automatic                alerts to the site team if noise levels are exceeded, if this is the case methodology will be assessed and the local                authority notified.                 If additional noise reduction is required then John F Hunt can deploy Monarflex MonarSound acoustic                scaffold sheeting Tested to BS EN ISO 717-1 at Napier University for sound reduction providing a Noise                reduction to ISO 717-1: 19dB. Moreover this can be coated with ReactivAir adding the further benefit of                pollution reduction.                 Decibel scale explanation                The decibel (dB) scale is a logarithmic unit of measurement used to quantify the intensity or level of sound.                The decibel scale starts at 0 dB, which represents the quietest sound that the average human ear can detect,                often referred to as the threshold of hearing. What makes the dB scale unique is its logarithmic nature. Each                10 dB increase on the scale corresponds to a tenfold increase in intensity. For example, 10 dB is 10 times more                intense than 0 dB, and 20 dB is 100 times more intense than 0 dB.                 A quiet whisper is typically around 20-30 dB. It’s barely audible, similar to leaves rustling gently in the breeze                or the sound of breathing. Speaking at a normal conversation level registers at about 60-70 dB. This is akin to                the hum of a refrigerator or light traffic noise. Heavy traffic, like that found on a busy city street, can reach                80-85 dB. This is similar to the sound of a garbage disposal or a vacuum cleaner.                 Attending a rock concert or sports event can expose you to sound levels between 100-120 dB. This is as loud                as a chainsaw or a jet engine at takeoff. Prolonged exposure to sounds at or above 120 dB can be painful and                potentially damaging to your hearing. This is equivalent to a thunderclap or a gunshot.
