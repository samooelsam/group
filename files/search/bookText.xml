                              PPE USE DURING THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC                                               get home safely,
                                                                                                                  every day




    The COVID-19 outbreak has had a huge effect on PPE stock levels globally. It is vital we reserve our stock to ensure that we are supplying sites with
    what is actually necessary, whilst not allowing waste of critical PPE items.  This document is to be displayed on site notice boards and carried out as
    a TBT to all site operatives.  There are a number of key items that are currently in demand globally to allow for our nations response to the virus.
    These are listed below:


                                P2/P3 masks:  Sites are to review safe systems of works and where possible use extraction and suppression systems to remove the need
                                for RPE.  RPE is to be issued and signed for by the individual, ensure that the maximum usage from the mask is utilised.  Rubber (non
                                disposable masks) are to be returned to the stores when no longer required and not discarded.  Filters are to be replaced and the mask
                                cleaned as per the manufactures guidance with warn soapy water.  Ideally the mask will be held for 72hours in the store prior to re
                                issue.

                                With a large volume of clear glasses now being diverted to front line services, we must ensure that we prolong the life of these on site.
                                All safety glasses are to be signed for at initial issue.  To exchange these, the used pair will be brought to the stores and inspected prior
                                to exchange being agreed.  The main shortage is with clear glasses.  For outdoor operations consider tinted glasses.  Impact protection
                                goggles used for short duration works such as breaking and use of petrol saws, are to be issued with the tool and returned to the stores
                                when the task is complete. These are to be cleaned as per the manufactures guidance with warn soapy water.  Ideally they will be
                                held for 72 hours in the store prior to re-issue.

                                Sites are to review the need for disposable gloves throughout site.  Where possible (for operations such as
                                cleaning etc.) impervious gloves such as marigolds should be employed.  These are to be washed after the
                                task in warm soapy water as per the government hand cleaning guidance for 20 seconds in order to allow
                                them to be re-used.



                                Disposable overalls use is to be restricted to safety critical tasks only.  Operatives are to be instructed to
                                regularly wash there orange outer trousers and vests.  Alternatives such as waterproof trousers should be
                                considered for tasks such as concrete placement allowing them to be washed and reused.]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[Let’s all

                              Disposable overshoes are to be used for safety critical tasks only.  The use of these at site entrance points to prevent muck from site being
                              transferred into office space is to cease.  Increased boot wash stations are to be employed or footwear changing areas to remove the
                              need for this.





                              Where possible the use of antibacterial products such as hand sanitiser,  disinfectant wipes and gels are to be replaced with the use of hot
                              soapy water in line with the government guidance for cleaning and hygiene.  These products are to only be used in areas where the use of
                              hot soapy water is not practicable such as site entry points and on site areas.






                                            ORDERING:  All PPE orders are to be reviewed by the Project Manager to ensure that they are not excessive for the tasks
                                            on site.  Sites are to ensure that they order PPE on a task specific bases ensuring that a redundant stock or excessive
                                            volume is not held on site.  All PPE to be supplied by Thameside supplies.




                                            ISSUING: All PPE must be signed for using the PPE register.  On issue of the PPE operatives are to be made aware of the
                                            contents of this briefing.




                                            USE: Project Management teams will continue to monitor the use of PPE on site to ensure that it is used in line with
                                            current guidance and the best potential life span of required items is maintained.]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[Let’s all

   PREPARING THE BRIEFING THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS CORRECTLY
   COMMUNICATED.
   Sites are to hold a daily coordination meeting at a time specified by the Project Manager. This will
   be attended by all supervisors delivering briefings.

   Site teams will discuss the following days activities, the risks and potential changes on site. This
   allows the supervisors in attendance to take notes and in turn develop the daily briefing they will
   deliver the following morning.





   Workers whose first language is not English must be able to demonstrate they have a basic
   understanding of both written and spoken English.

   Assign an English-speaking worker who can translate and communicate to a group of workers
   (maximum of four in a group).

           attention.

           machine prior to giving the thumbs up and
           allow anyone to enter the area.

           NEVER enter the ‘at risk’ area of a piece of

           ensure you let them know when you have

           are sure the area is clear.
